# SFProfileGenerator v2.3

Auto-merge permissions for Salesforce profiles, supports all tags as of API 46.

Released under the **GNU General Public License** version 3. Feel free to contribute!

The code is still in a development stage, this is a functional prototype.

Please report any bugs to the developer.

----------------------------------------

**Generated profiles are indented using \t, which sometimes may appear as if the entire file has been deleted and replaced. This is a known issue and a solution is in development.**

Happy merging!
